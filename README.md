# TraffickingLight

A machine learning driven approach to monitoring online activities of human trafficking. The system processes csv files generated from Twitter JSON and produces machine learning models that could reliably identify Twitter Posts associated with human trafficking. The system also generates interesting keywords within the posts based on their TFIDF scores. The project is written in Python but the Twitter crawling part is done in Java which will be uploaded later as a separate portion.
